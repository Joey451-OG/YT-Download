This is a temporary note describing the yt-dlp update in the new version.

2024-01-31
So the guy who wrote PySimpleGUI has such an ego that they now want users to register with a license key
in order to use the library. I'm switching to a different GUI library holy shit that guy is insane if they
think I'm PAYING to use what amounts to a TKinter WRAPPER wtf.

Other than that my little windows machine to update the libraries properly, I will not be releasing a new
version until I port to a new GUI library.
